# Background Sound Privacy Policy

_Version 1.1 on 2017-03-14_

The Background Sound application uses the microphone to provide a dynamic visualization of sound activity around an Android device.
The application makes no communication with a server except that communication which is inherent to the distribution of an Android
application through the Google Play Store. We therefore collect and store none of your personal information.

## Use of the microphone

The Background Sound application continuously monitors the device's microphone while the home screen is visible, in order to render
a visualization of the sound in real time. The application does not itself store persistently locally or transmit this data remotely
from the device, in raw or aggregate form under any circumstances.

## Use of other data

The Background Sound application makes no use of any other personal data, and does not store or transmit such data beyond what is
automatically done by Google for any Android application distributed using Google Play.

## Updates to this policy

Any change to this policy, beyond clarification of the existing content, which has impact on your privacy, will be accompanied by a
major version increment, and a prominent notice informing you of the change on the application store page.
